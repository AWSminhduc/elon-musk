    <p>Elon Reeve Musk is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder, CEO, and chief engineer of SpaceX; early investor, CEO, and product architect of Tesla, Inc.; owner and CEO of Twitter, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the philanthropic Musk Foundation. With an estimated net worth of around $200 billion as of February 2025, Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes's real-time billionaires list.</p>
    <p>Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, obtaining citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. He matriculated at Queen's University and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. In 1995, he moved to California to attend Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year, and was subsequently bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002.</p>
    <p>In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he serves as CEO and chief engineer. In 2004, he was an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company promoting friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brainâ€“computer interfaces, and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion, leading to significant changes in the platform's operations.</p>
    <p>Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system, and is the president of the philanthropic Musk Foundation, which donates to scientific research and education. He has been criticized for making unscientific and controversial statements, such as spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2018, he was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC but did not admit guilt, and temporarily stepped down from his chairmanship. In 2019, he won a defamation case brought against him by a British caver who Musk had called a "pedo guy".</p>
